# The most basic functions!
# grep() finds indices in a character vector that have strings that match a pattern
# grepl() tells you whether each index in a character vector matches a pattern, TRUE/FALSE
# gsub() replaces the part of a string that matches a pattern with another string
# stringr::str_extract() pulls out the first part of a string that matches a pattern
# stringr::str_split() splits a character string into a character vector at points that match a pattern

#### EXAMPLE ONE -----------------------------------------------
text1 <- "hellohello666"
text2 <- "hello hello 666"

## Basic regex
grepl(x = text1,
      pattern = "hello")
grepl(x = text1,
      pattern = "hello hello")
grepl(x = text2,
      pattern = "hello hello")


## Multiples
# Zero or more
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "(hello)*")
# One or more
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "(hello)+")
# Zero or one
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "(hello)?")

## Starts and ends
# Starts with
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "^hello")
# Ends with
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "hello$")

## Wildcards
# "Word" characters (alphanumerics)
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "\\w")
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "\\W")

stringr::str_extract(string = text2,
                     pattern = "\\w")
stringr::str_extract(string = text2,
                     pattern = "\\W")

# Digits
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "\\d")
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "\\D")

# Spaces
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = "\\s")
stringr::str_extract(string = text2,
                     pattern = "\\s")

# Anything
stringr::str_extract(string = text1,
                     pattern = ".")
stringr::str_extract(string = text2,
                     pattern = ".")

# Any of
grepl(x = c("aesthetic", "effervescent", "irredeemable", "opulent", "unctuous", "pariah"),
      pattern = "^[aeiou]")

## Groupings
grepl(x = c("aeiou: vowels", "a, e, i, o, u: vowels", "vowels: aeiou"),
      pattern = "(aeiou)")

grepl(x = c("aeiouaeiou", "aeiou", "aeiou aeiou"),
      pattern = "(aeiou){2}")

grepl(x = c("aeiouaeiou", "aeiouu"),
      pattern = "aeiou{2}")
